# VE281-Data_Structure_and_Algorithm
Projects from sjtu VE281

Note that there has been a time exceeding problem in the selection algorithm. Please make modification to store the value in variables instead of doing random access inside the vector.  

In general these project are of high quality except P4 and P5, coz there isn't too much time for the course.
I have to mention that there isn't too much reference materials given for P5 coz it's a bonus project, and it indeed brought me a lot of trouble. One of the TAs was also not familiar with front-end coding. It's more like a taste of building an app and the majority of the project was already given.
